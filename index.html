	<p>The topics are anime, anime openings, and 3DS games.
	<br>
	All three of these things are my way of life.
	These will be my <i>personal opinions</i> since it's still 2016.
	<br>
	For each topic, a picture and my opinion will be there, as well as a link to where you can learn more about each item.
	<br>
	Also, <b>don't get offended just because your favorite wasn't on any of these lists.</b>
	<br>
	It's still the year of 2016 so I might actually discover it, eventually.
