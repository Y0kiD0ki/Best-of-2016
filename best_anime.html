	<h1>Best Anime of 2016</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>I am an otaku who loves anime.
	When I was younger, a goal of my was to watch every single anime out there.
	Of course, that would take me forever but I still try to watch as many as I can.
	<br>
	2016 was a pretty good year of anime with stunning graphics, great plots, likeable characters, and enjoyable songs (We'll save that for later!)
	<br>
	I'm here to take a look and share all of my personal favorite 2016 animes.
	By the way, since this is a 2016 list, this will cover all four seasons of 2016.

			<td><b>Re:Zero -Starting Life in Another World-</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			You've probably heard of Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu or Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-. 
			It's a time travel anime combined with a fantasy world setting.
			This one stands out from the rest as it shows you awful, distrubing scenes of the characters' death and Subaru's, the main character, mentality as he dies and watches others die over and over again.
			It's a must watch and is probably one of the best 2016 anime.
			Let's hope they make another sequel! 
			<br>
			(<b>Spoiler ALERT:</b> Episode 15 is pretty messed up.)

			<td><b>Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School (Future, Despair, Hope)</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			This anime is only good if you know everything about Danganronpa, excluding V3.
			The whole Danganronpa 3 series consists of the Future arc, Despair arc, and Hope arc.
			My personal favorite is the Despair and Hope arcs because Despair focuses on the origin story of the Renmants of Despair and the Hope arc is the final conclusion to the entire Hope's Peak Academy story.
			For all of you English dub haters, watch the dub to get some exclusive lines that will only appear in the dub.
			"Kamukura Kamukura yas queen" and "they live and die by the meme" will never be in the Japanese version.
			But beware, this anime is, like Re:Zero, messed up as well.
			Be prepared  to see some disturbing, gorey scenes that will really fill you with despair.

			<br>
			<br>
			Another great time travel anime!
			Armed with Revival, an ability that sends Satoru back a few minutes to prevent a tragedy, he somehow travels to the time back when he was still in elementary school and attempts to prevent a kidnapping incident that took the lives of three of his classmates.
			This anime has an unique identity because of its original story plot!

			<td><b>D.Gray-man Hallow</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			D.Gray-man was a fantastic anime! 
			Sadly, the anime ended on a cliff hanger that made all of us just waiting for a continuation to the series.
			Finally, after <b>8 YEARS</b>, we have a sequel!
			In addition to the continuing story plot, the graphics are crisp and the voice actors are doing a better job than the original cast!

			<td><b>Assassination Classroom Season 2</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			The continuation of the first season of Assassination Classroom.
			See if Class 3-E can kill Koro-sensei and discover his origin story and reason for being a teacher in this epic finale.
			<br>
			(<b>Spoiler ALERT:</b>The ending made me cry!)

			<td><b>Haikyuu!!: Karasuno Koukou VS Shiratorizawa Gakuen Koukou</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			The final match between Karasuno and Shiratorizawa.
			With its fresh, crisp animation, the fast-paced volleyball action keeps you on your toes!
			Additionally, the character development and the importance of teamwork and self-improvement are just expanding as the story progresses.
			Will Karasuno make it to Nationals or suffer defeat?

			<td><b>Bungo Stray Dogs</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			This may be another "people with supernatural powers" anime, but this one is different.
			This anime is filled with memorable characters, including the suicide-lover Dazai Osamu, 
			<br>
			as well as fluid animation and dry dark humor.

			<td><b>Food Wars! The Second Plate</b>
			<br>
			<br>
			The continuation of the first season of Food Wars.
			Food Wars is one of the best cooking animes that even teaches you the food science of how a dish is well made.
			<br>
			(I learned that honey can tenderize meat!)
			This anime <i>might</i> be inappropriate for the younger audience.

			<br>
			<br>
			Does the occult and the supernatural interest you?
			Sink into this anime that follows the perspectives and stories of nine characters whos' lives are all connected by a single occult summary blog.
			It will be interesting to see how these characters will be involved in something big that might change what is considered as common sense.

			Have you always just wanted to go back to the good ol' days when you were younger?
			Would you still desire that even if you have to take a mysterious pill?
			That's the situation for Arata Kaizaki, a total loser who is unemployed and struggles to get a job!
			Just to see a 27 year old guy looking like a 17 year old highschooler and failing at everything in highschool is really all I need to convince me to watch this anime!

			Just like Re:Zero, this anime is super hyped up because it was made by the creator of One Punch Man.

			This anime is certainly a special one with its unique art style, comedy, and quirkiness.

			<br>
			<br>
			An anime about Japanese candy.
			Who doesn't want to learn about Japan's candy industries?

			The anime isn't as bad as I thought with its original story concept and a slow romance forming between the two characters.
