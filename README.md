# Best-of-2016

The first website I have ever made. For a high school coding class during my sophomore year.
It's a list (in no particular order) of anime, anime openings, and video games I enjoyed in 2016.

NOTE: index.html is the home page. Also, some links might be broken now.

Features:
- Tabs to navigate the to the other pages
- Hyperlinks to various websites and YouTube links attached to the pictures
- Beautiful use of CSS with all the colors
