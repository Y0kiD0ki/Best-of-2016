	<h1>Best Anime Openings of 2016</h1>
	<hr>
	<p>I am an otaku who loves the songs that play before an episode begins.
	Anime openings are the introduction to every anime episode. 
	<br>
	They are the hype machine that gets you excited for the episode you are about to see.
	<br>
	But, they get annoying after about three episodes in.
	On the other hand, some songs are just great and you never get tired of them.
